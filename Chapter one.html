    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a
        long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
    <p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what
        is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).
    </p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

    <h1 align="center">Body, Head and Title</h1>
    <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
    <p>Anything within the body of a web page is
        displayed in the main browser window.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is an HTML page that I created in TextEdit.</p>

    <h1 align="center">View Source</h1>
    <h1>How to View the Source of This Page</h1>
    <p>If you go to your web browser's View menu, you will see an option that allows you to see the source code behind a
        web
        page.</p>
    <p>When the web was first taking off this was a very popular way for people to learn how web pages had been built.
    </p>
    <p>Today, people still often view the source of pages to learn how a web page has been built.</p>
